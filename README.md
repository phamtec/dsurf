## Building this project

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make test
```

## Running this

```
./dsurf ../test/complex.json
```

Use the mouse wheel (or double finger up and down on a traockpad) to zoom.
Double click to zoom in where you clicked. Shift+Double click to zoom back out.
Click and drag to pan around.

Keys:
- Hit q to exit.
- Follow the heads up display for other keys.
- Arrows left and write to navigate through editing text.
- Backspace to delete text

## Running tests

The tests use BOOST test, to run

```
make test
```

## Interactive debugging on a Mac

There is a cool little script you can use like this in a command window:

```
cd build
../run.sh ../test ./TestSpatial scaleAndCenter
```

This will monitor the "test" directory for changes to a file, if it finds them it will do a "make" and then if that is successful it will run the program "./TestSpatial" specifying the test "scaleAndCenter" to run.

You can split your screen to see this command window and your text editor and interactively make changes, save and see results :-)

If you want to compile things that change in the source dir, just change the command to

```
../run.sh ../src ./TestSpatial scaleAndCenter
```

## Testing

The end to end tests use cucumber (Ruby), to get that going:

```
sudo bundle install
```

You will only need to do that once to install the ruby stuff.

```
./test.sh
```

These aren't ready for prime time on linux but work on a Mac.

## Progress

You can run the app, copy in JSON, edit the JSON nodes as text and then copy it
back out.

## Current Focus

- Editing multiple objects.
  
## Pipeline

- Bug fixes
- Distribution on mac and linux
- Windows version
